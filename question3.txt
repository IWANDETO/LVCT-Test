I would like to work with LVCT Health Kenya because of their impactful work and commitment to improving the public health sector in our Country. LVCT has a diverse community that is dedicated to serve and works collaboratively to implement innovative solutions that address health community challenges such as gender-based violence, HIV/AIDS, TB, reproductive health. Working with LVCT Health would provide me with an opportunity to work on and contribute to meaningful projects in health where I would apply my problem solving skills and help come up with innovative solutions that will help combat the problems that we face in the society.This opportunity will go a long way in  helping the  realization of building of  a healthier community and making a positive impact in peopleâ€™s lives.
