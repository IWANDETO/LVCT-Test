1. We create a database with ID as the primary key field and records as a secondary field.
2. Initialize a counter variable (Counter = 0)
3. Initialize a for loop to iterate through the database (For record in database)
4. Increment the counter(Counter = Counter + 1)
5. Check if the current record is the third one(if counter % 3 = 0) 
6. Increment the ID field by 5 (ID = ID + 5 ) 
7. We then update the record in the database with the new ID value
8. End the for loop
